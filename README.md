# Mood AI Project
This project uses my daily activities and my previous mood to predict my mood. I wrote a paper that is included in the repository.

The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was 1.3 for both the linear regression and CNN approaches, with an R^2 of about 0.67. This indicates that our mood can be roughly predicted based on our activities.

## Future
- Find useful data to be displayed to users nearing a burnout and methods to improve tomorrow's mood.
- Streamline with Excel/Notion to provide continuous predictions.
