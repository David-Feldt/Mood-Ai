# Mood Ai project
This project uses my daily activites and my previous mood to predict my mood. I wrote a paper that is included in the repo.

The RMSE was 1.3 for both the linear regression and CNN approach and a R^2 of about 0.67. This shows that are mood can be rougly guessed based on what we do.

## Future
- Find useful data to be dispalyed to user user coming close to a burnout / methods to improve tomorrows mood
- stream line with excel/ notion to give contious prediction
